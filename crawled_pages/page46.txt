Led by CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI became a story unto itself when Altman was briefly fired and then brought back after pressure from staff and Microsoft, an investor and close partner.OpenAIOpenAIAn official OpenAI X account was taken over to peddle a crypto scamJay PetersSep 23|CommentsWExternal LinkCommentsWes DavisSep 23Link“All of physics,” you say?Sam Altman published some thoughts today about what artificial intelligence will mean in a couple of decades. Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs – fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics – will eventually become commonplace.Altman, who reportedly recently told employees OpenAI is moving away from its non-profit-controlled structure, makes other lofty, hard-to-believe claims. One claim — “there will also be downsides” — feels on the money, though.The Intelligence Age[ia.samaltman.com]WExternal LinkCommentsWes DavisSep 23LinkOpenAI wants to help get more AI in more places.The company announced OpenAI Academy, which it says “will invest in developers and organizations leveraging AI to help solve hard problems and catalyze economic growth in their communities.”Details such as how to apply and when the program will launch are scant, but OpenAI says the academy will offer AI training and technical guidance and $1 million in API credits, among other things.Introducing the OpenAI Developer Academy[OpenAI]TechTechJony Ive confirms he’s working on a new device with OpenAIAlex CranzSep 21|CommentsOpenAIOpenAIOpenAI’s new model is better at reasoning and, occasionally, deceivingKylie RobisonSep 17|CommentsOpenAIOpenAIOpenAI is launching an ‘independent’ safety board that can stop its model releasesJay PetersSep 16|CommentsWExternal LinkCommentsWes DavisSep 14LinkStep four: Profit.CEO Sam Altman told employees in a company-wide meeting that OpenAI’s complicated corporate structure as a for-profit endeavor under the umbrella of a non-profit is set to change, “likely sometime next year,” reports Fortune.The reconfiguring, which has been rumored before, would reportedly shift the company “away from being controlled by a non-profit.” OpenAI told the outlet that the “non-profit is core to our mission and will continue to exist.”Sam Altman told OpenAI staff the company’s non-profit corporate structure will change next year[Fortune]KExternal LinkCommentsKylie RobisonSep 13LinkOpenAI rates its new model “medium” risk.OpenAI unveiled the first in a series of “reasoning” models on Thursday, accompanied by a safety card highlighting some alarming capabilities. It’s also the first time the startup has rated a model “medium” risk.The weirdest part, as Transformer points out, is that the researchers found that the new model “sometimes instrumentally faked alignment during testing” and would strategically manipulate “task data in order to make its misaligned action look more aligned”.

Enterprise pricing varies, but one person claimed it could cost around $60 per user per month with a minimum of 150 users and a 12-month contract.I always thought the only way AI might make some cash is through enterprise software bundling, especially with all the free users.OpenAI Hits 1 Million Paid Users For Business Version of ChatGPT[Bloomberg]KExternal LinkCommentsKylie RobisonSep 4LinkOpenAI cofounder raises $1 billion for his OpenAI rival.OpenAI’s ex-chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who left not long after attempting to oust fellow co-founder Sam Altman, has now raised $1 billion for his competing lab, Safe Superintelligence (SSI).

OpenAI will display Condé Nast’s content in its new AI-powered search engine prototype, SearchGPT (but provided no details on if it’s using Condé’s content as training data).These media/AI company deals are becoming more common because media execs seem to believe that accepting the money, rather than laying off staff to afford lengthy legal battles, is the best option for now.

And the reason startups work is because people work like hell.Update, August 14th: It appears that Schmidt didn’t intend for his comments to make headlines!

On one hand, they’ve already persuaded more than 6 million people to go before an Orb and sign up for a World ID, and the sign-up rate has been surging this year. The total value of the digital currency (WLD) is more than $550 million. At a factory in Germany, Orbs are heading toward mass production and will soon be dispersed around the globe in a bid to push these numbers even higher.How Worldcoin Is Building Digital IDs to Combat the AI Apocalypse[Bloomberg]OpenAIOpenAIChatGPT now lets free users generate up to two images per day made by DALL-E 3Jay PetersAug 8|CommentsOpenAIOpenAIOpenAI says its latest GPT-4o model is ‘medium’ riskKylie RobisonAug 8|CommentsKTwitterCommentsKylie RobisonAug 8LinkOpenAI gets a new board member.The startup has appointed Zico Kolter, a professor and the director of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, to its board of directors.

In a reply post on X, CEO Sam Altman thanked Schulman and said he “laid out a significant fraction of what became OpenAI’s initial strategy.”In his new job, Schulman will work closely with Jan Leike, another senior leader who recently left OpenAI for Anthropic due to concerns that safety had taken a backseat to business priorities.OpenAIOpenAIElon Musk is suing OpenAI and Sam Altman againJess WeatherbedAug 5|CommentsOpenAIOpenAIOpenAI won’t watermark ChatGPT text because its users could get caughtWes DavisAug 5|CommentsAExternal LinkCommentsAlex HeathAug 3LinkMicrosoft now lists OpenAI as a competitor.CNBC spotted the update this week in Microsoft’s risk factors with the SEC. These are managed by lawyers to help shield companies from shareholders lawsuits and generally pretty conservative.

So strange.KTwitterCommentsKylie RobisonAug 1LinkOpenAI makes more safety promises.Sam Altman announced that OpenAI is collaborating with the US AI Safety Institute for early access to their next foundation model (but no release date was specified.)He also emphasized OpenAI’s commitment to dedicating 20% of computing resources to safety, a promise originally made to the now-defunct Superalignment team. Plus, he noted that OpenAI has removed non-disparagement clauses for employees and provisions allowing the cancellation of vested equity.AI has a climate problem — but so does all of techHow do you decide if AI is ‘worth’ the energy?Nilay PatelAug 1|CommentsPaginationPage 1 of 6NextMost PopularMost PopularWhat’s this new mystery Nintendo device?Marvel’s new Thunderbolts trailer is armed to the teethGoogle TV Streamer review: smarter than your average set-top boxX will let people you’ve blocked see your postsArc creator Josh Miller on why you need a better browser than ChromeVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
