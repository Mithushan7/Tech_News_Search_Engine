Holding $OPENAI will grant access to all of our future beta programs.” The post also included a link to a spoofed version of OpenAI’s website at a URL that wasn’t openai.com.Two posts from the hijacked OpenAI Newsroom account. Screenshot by Jay Peters / The VergeWhen I visited the site, there was a section for claiming the $OPENAI cryptocurrency. When I clicked the button, it asked me to connect a wallet, which I didn’t do.If you find yourself on this website, do not connect your crypto wallet.

As of this writing, the OpenAI Newsroom account hasn’t posted anything to explain what might have happened. The account launched at the beginning of this month.CommentsMost PopularMost PopularWhat’s this new mystery Nintendo device?Marvel’s new Thunderbolts trailer is armed to the teethGoogle TV Streamer review: smarter than your average set-top boxX will let people you’ve blocked see your postsArc creator Josh Miller on why you need a better browser than ChromeVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
